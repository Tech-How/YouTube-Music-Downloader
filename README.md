# YouTube-Music-Downloader
A frontend for youtube-dl, adding metadata to downloaded tracks.

This project will allow you to use [youtube-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download music from YouTube Music, and automatically add album artwork, artist name, album name, and track info to the files. This project is still very early in development, and as such there will be issues. Some metadata pulled from YouTube is formatted in a way that confuses the downloader and will cause incorrect data to be applied. This document includes a detailed explanation of how the downloader works. If you find an issue that is reproducable under specific conditions, or have general feedback, feel free to open an issue report.
