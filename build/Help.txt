Welcome!

This script will help you automatically download content from YouTube Music as MP3 files and use them with other media programs.
All available track information, including album artwork, is downloaded and applied to the file.

Please note:
When finding URLs, make sure the item you selected is a song. Videos are currently unsupported.


How to use:
1: Click the Visit YouTube Music shortcut. (Or go to https://music.youtube.com)
2: Search for a song, playlist, or album, and copy the link from the share button.
3: Open the Add Music script, and paste your links in.

Each of your songs will be downloaded and placed in this directory, under the YTMusic folder.
NOTE: The downloader window will close when all the items in the queue have finished. Closing this window manually may result in corrupted downloads.


Other Information:
The Cache folder is used during downloads to place music and artwork before the metadata is formatted with ffmpeg. This data is deleted at the end of each download.

When you add music, the song IDs are placed in the URLs.txt file. Each line is read by the downloader and the corresponding song is downloaded.
After the downloader has finished going through all of the songs, the next time the program is run the URLs.txt file is renamed to URLs.txt.bak.
3 of these backups are kept at one time, in case you need to redownload previous music. These will be deleted automatically; there's no need to modify them unless you are restoring one.

NOTE: The URLs.txt file is not intended to be edited manually. The exact URLs are not stored, only the video IDs. Entering full URLs will not work.
